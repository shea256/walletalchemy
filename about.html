        <h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
        <p>WalletAlchemy was founded by two Princeton students who found it odd that people strapped for cash often have opportunities to reliably buy laptops or armchairs with store credit but may find it quite difficult to get cash at a reasonable interest rate. Sean and Ryan set out to reconcile this apparent gap in the market and bring access to cash at low interest rates to Americans in debt.</p>

      <div class="grid_5 suffix_1">
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>WalletAlchemy provides short-term financing to debtors in need of a loan at a rate that is significantly more manageable than available in the market today.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_5 prefix_1">
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>To help debtors escape from the debt spiral by providing a low interest rate alternative to payday loans.</p>
